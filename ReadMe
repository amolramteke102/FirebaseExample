Steps

1. Enabling Firebase Auth

1. First thing you need to do is go to https://firebase.google.com/ and make an account to gain access to their console. After you gain access to the console you can start by creating your first project.

2. Give the package name of your project (mine is info.androidhive.firebase) in which you are going to integrate the Firebase. Here the google-services.json file will be downloaded when you press add app button.

3. Next go to your project dashboard. Find the Auth and click get started. Go to set up sign in method and choose Email & Password and enable it

 5.Paste the google-services.json file to your project’s app folder. This step is very important as your project won’t build without this file.

6. Now open the build.gradle located in project’s home directory and add firebase dependency.
build.gradle
dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.2'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
 
        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }

7. Open app/build.gradle and add firebase auth dependency. At the very bottom of the file, add apply plugin: ‘com.google.gms.google-services’
app/build.gradle
dependencies {
    compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:9.0.2"
}
 
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
